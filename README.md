# Simple NLP Tasks
I have used the NLTK library for natural language processing tasks. I have downloaded an ebook "The Tales of Chinatown" from https://www.gutenberg.org/.
Then performed the following steps:

Performed word tokenization (split the text into words).
Converted all tokenized words to lower case.
Removed stopwords and punctuation.
Implemented stemming and lemmatization to identify words with the same root.
Count of each of the unique words in the dataset.
